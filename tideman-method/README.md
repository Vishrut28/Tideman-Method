## What is Tideman Method?
Tideman method, also known as Ranked Pairs, was designed by Nicolaus Tideman in 1987. Tideman's main object was to create an election system which is independent of clones. In a system that has independence of clones criterion, adding a candidate similar to a current candidate does not alter the election's winner.
